npm init
npm i express socket.io

****
step1-> client clicks button msg_sent and send  socket.emit
step2->server listens io.on msg_sent and send through io.emit
step3> client listens theought socket.on msg_rcvd and displays msg 

Note->
io.emit() is done in server.js because then server sends to all sockets.
if we do socket.emit() in server then it will send in only that particular socket
socket.broadcast.emit send to all except that

Rooms->
for chat apps instead of broadcast we can make rooms and message will be sent to everyone in rooms
we make each socket as a room and room is named on name of person.so we can send io.to(reciver)
